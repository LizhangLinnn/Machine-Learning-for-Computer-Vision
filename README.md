# Machine-Learning-for-Computer-Vision

MLCV1 - investigated decision tree, random forest and visual codebook.

MLCV2 - investigated interest point detectors (Harris detector, SIFT etc.), scale-invariant and rotational-invariant feature descriptors, feature matching techniques, RANSAC for estimating homography and fundamental matrix, disparity map and depth map (3D reconstruction from a pair of 2D images). 

For more information, please see the reports and their descriptions.
